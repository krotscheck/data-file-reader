# Contributing

You may contribute in the following ways:

##1: Write a unit test

We maintain a high standard of code coverage, however we know there are still
loopholes in our testing. If there is a bug that you've identified, 
please write the corresponding unit test and submit it as a patch to the 
project. We'll fix it for you.

##2: Submit a patch

If your request includes new functionality, please implement it and submit a 
patch against our repository, ensuring that our unit test, coverage, and 
formatting standards are met. We'll get to it as quickly as possible.

##3: File a bug

While we cannot guarantee that we can prioritize your request, 
we'll do our best to acommodate you.
