$h1 data-file-reader
<span class="lead">${project.description}</span>

The goal of this project is to make the reading and writing of table style
file formats simple. If you have specific file format needs, 
you may review currently supported file formats using the features dropdown 
in the top right, or or write your own.

The base file encoder and decoder both use the ServiceLocator to detect 
available converters. Simply register any new mime type adapters in the 
corresponding META-INF/services file, and they will be automatically applied 
based on the mimetype you select.

The below dependency includes csv, bson, and json support. You may also 
include the individual file converters individually.

$h2 Reading a File

To read a file, open an InputStream from your location, construct a decoder, 
and treat it like an iterator.

    InputStream inputStream = ResourceUtil.getResourceAsStream("my_file");
    String myMimeType = "text/mymimetype";
    FileStreamDecoder decoder = new FileStreamDecoder(inputStream, myMimeType);
    decoder.setInputStream(inputStream);
    
    for(Map<String, Object> row : decoder) {
        // Do something
    }
    decoder.close();


$h2 Writing a File

You may write arbitrary data rows to a file format of your choosing, 
simply by specifying an outputStream and a mimetype.

    OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("my_file_path");
    String myMimeType = "text/mymimetype";
    FileStreamEncoder encoder = new FileStreamEncoder(outputStream, myMimeType);
    
    Map<String, Object> myRow = new HashMap<String, Object>();
    encoder.write(myRow);
    
    encoder.close();


$h2 Converting a File

This library also provides a convenience file format converter. You may either
call `run()` directly, or you may pass it to a thread as shown below.


        IDataDecoder decoder = new MyDataDecoder();
        IDataEncoder encoder = new MyDataEncoder();
        
        FileStreamConverter fsc = new FileStreamConverter(decoder, encoder);
        
        Thread converterThread = new Thread(fsc);
        converterThread.start();
